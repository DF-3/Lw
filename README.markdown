# Lw
Lw is a general-purpose statically-typed functional language with advanced features.
It is currently in development and some of its features are yet to come or still unstable, nonetheless it has reached
a stage at which people who enjoy experimenting with new programming languages may start to play with it.

I will update this README file in the near future and document the most interesting among its constructs and features.
Consider, however, that any feature may change in the future or may get broken at some point until a stable version is released ;)
